# GRC-NLI (Proof of Concept)

A feasibility study to evaluate whether fine-tuning a Natural Language Inference (NLI) cross-encoder model can determine if a cybersecurity control‚Äîsuch as a procedure or configuration setting‚Äî**supports an IT audit statement**.

## üí° Objective

Use cases include:

-   Internal self-checks before formal audits
-   Automating audit validation workflows

This is part of a larger pipeline:

**üîç SBERT Retrieval** ‚Äî top-k cosine similarity
‚Üí **‚öñÔ∏è Cross-Encoder Reranker** ‚Äî filters irrelevant results
‚Üí **üß† NLI Entailment Validator** ‚Äî confirms support relationship

Compare inference accuracy between:

-   **Original model**: `cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-large`
-   **Fine-tuned version**: `./v1_finetuned_nli-deberta-v3-large` (trained on synthetic GRC pairs)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

> All datasets are **synthetically generated** using GPT-4o. This project is strictly for testing and research purposes.

## üì¶ Model Availability

The fine-tuned model (`./v1_finetuned_nli-deberta-v3-large`) is **not included** in this repository.
Feel free to run `train_model.py` to reproduce it locally.

## üíª Fun Fact

This entire model was fine-tuned on a single NVIDIA 3060 Ti GPU.
Training took only about **5‚Äì10 minutes** for the full dataset.
Training used a fixed random seed (`42`) for reproducibility.
